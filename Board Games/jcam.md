## Setup and Mechanics

* Shuffle all decks including jokers together.
* Place all marbles in the appropriate home position.
* Teams are made up by every-other-player.
  * If you are in a 4-person game, the player directly across from you is on your team
  * If you are in a 6-or-more-person game, your team mates are every other person.
* Deal 5 cards to each player
* Players can complete one move by placing a card into the discard pile and completing the action, then drawing a new card.
  * If you have a move to play, you must play the move, **even if it hurts**
  * If you do not have a move to play, place one card in a burn pile in front of you face down and draw a new card. On the 5th burn, you may take a marble out of your home and place all five cards from the burn pile into the discard pile.
* You may NOT jump on or over your own marble. You may jump on or over other people's marbles
  * Stopping on a friendly marble moves them to the base of their castle
  * Stopping on an enemy marble moves them back into their home
* The point of the game is to move all of your marbles from inside your home to inside your castle.
  * Once all of your marbles are in your castle, you begin to play for your team mate to your left. 
  * When their castle is full, you both play for the next player if it is a larger game.
  * The game ends when a team has all of their marbles in the castle.

### Card Actions

| Card | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ace | Move 1 space forward or start a marble |
| Face  | Move 10 spaces forward or start a marble |
| 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 | Move forward the value of the card |
| 7 | Move forward 7 spaces. This can also be split between two of your own marbles, both going forward. A game can not end on a half used 7. You may also use part of a 7 to move a marble into your castle and the remainder to move a marble of a partner to your left. |
| 8 | Move backwards 8 spaces |
| 9 | Move forward 9 spaces. This can also be split between two of your own marbles, one going forward, one going backwards. A game can not end on a half used 9. You may also use part of a 9 to move a marble into your castle and the remainder to move a marble of a partner to your left. |
| Joker | May be used by taking one of your marbles \(preferably from home\) and landing on any marble on the board that is not yours. A joker must always involve two marbles. If you bump a partner, their marble goes to the base of their castle. If you bump an enemy, it goes back into their home. |

## House Rules and Interpretations

There have been some loopholes found in the original rules presented to me. I've added the interpretations of the different homes we have played with. Default is Panhandle rules. Determine house ruleset before playing the game to avoid frustration.

### Panhandle

| Card | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7, 9 | _You may also use part of a 7 or 9 to move a marble into your castle and the remainder to move a marble of a partner to your left._  **This only applies when you are placing your LAST marble into the castle and therefore immediately begin playing for the next player.** |

### North Central

| Card | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7, 9 | _You may also use part of a 7 or 9 to move a marble into your castle and the remainder to move a marble of a partner to your left._  **You may do this when placing any marble into your castle. This provides some team interaction before you begin playing for another player.** |
