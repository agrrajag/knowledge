# Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

## Group Policy and Targeting
Group Policies can be set up to place all devices into computer groups within WSUS, define the time the computer checks WSUS for new updates, and sets up active hours in Windows 10 to ensure the machine does not install/restart during work hours. Group policies DO NOT choose which or deploy updates.

### Targeting a GPO to a WSUS Computer Group
```
Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update
```
* Enable Client-side targeting
* Type in the group name of the WSUS computer group 
    * I believe this is case sensitive.

### Setting time to check WSUS
```
Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update
```
* Configure Automatic Updates
* Scheduled install time â€“ set the time in military time
    * Do not schedule all at the same time as you might DDOS the WSUS server.

### Modifying Active Hours
```
Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update
```
* Turn off auto-restart for updates during active hours
* Set your start and end times for when computers are active.

## WSUS Console

### Updates and Automatic Availability
Assuming all computers have been placed in their appropriate groups, these settings determine what automatically get pushed to computers.

#### Products and Classifications
```
Options -> Products and Classifications -> switch between the product and classification tabs.
```
This determines what the server will pull down from the official Microsoft Server. This does not automatically import upgrades. You can find this list in 

#### Automatic Approvals
``` 
Options -> Automatic Approvals 
```
This determines what specifically goes to each computer group. To modify which groups receive which products, you can either edit a rule or create a new one.
