## Note

When working with cabling, ensure your circuit is no longer energized, even in low voltage situations. A short has the possibility to injure and/or kill the person working on the circuit.

## Electrical

### Stage Pin

Ground in middle sticks out further than the rest. Hot is the farthest pin from ground. Neutral is closest to ground.

* Black – Hot
* White – Neutral
* Green - Ground

### Phono Jacks - Unbalanced \(TS, TRS\)

* Tip – Signal/Hot
* Ring – Cold – Unused in TS
* Sleeve – Ground/Shield

### Phono Jacks – Unbalanced \(TRRS\)

> NOTE – If this is for a non-audio application, the wiring is different.

* Tip – Left Audio
* Ring 1 – Right Audio
* Ring 2 – Ground for all
* Sleeve - Microphone
