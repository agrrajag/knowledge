# Wireless Microphone Legal Use

Wireless Microphones in the United States must adhere to FCC regulations for unlicensed devices. The following common frequencies can no longer be used by the posted date

| **Band:** | 700Mhz | 600Mhz |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency Range:** | 698-806 MHz | 614-698MHz |
| **Public Notice:** | March 20, 2008 | April 13, 2017 |
| **Cease and Desist Date:** | **June 12, 2010** | **July 13, 2020** |

> NOTE: You may also not broadcast on any frequency that interferes with a licensed broadcast station

# Subtractive Equalization

When working with audio, headroom is always a necessity. You always want your main audio source to be able to cut through the rest of the mix. You also want to make sure your instruments aren’t blending into a mess. Subtractive EQ allows you to push microphones or instruments harder to stand out in the mix. With a bad equalization, you will be limited to how much you can push a microphone before it causes feedback. While not all audio engineers like this method, a “boost and sweep” method is the quickest way to get close to a good mix – from there, you can fine-tune. There are many tutorials for subtractive equalization online, but here’s the simplest way I have found to do it:

## Step 1 - Zero Out Your EQ

First, **WARN ANYONE IN THE ROOM THAT THIS IS ABOUT TO GET EXTREMELY ANNOYING**. If you don’t have a usable starting point already, go ahead and zero out your equalization. Turn all the gain knobs to where the equalization has no effect. This gives you a flat processing through the board, and the most flexibility going forward. At this step, you will also want to put your main speakers at 0 \(turned up to normal volume\) and your microphone to 0 \(turned up to normal volume\) if you have it gained properly.

## Step 2 – Set your High Pass Filter \(HPF\)

High Pass Filter \(HPF\), also known as a low-cut, will take out anything below the set frequency on the HPF. That means if I have my HPF set at 250Hz, and I try to send a signal of 100Hz through the board, it will be stopped by the HPF. Set this to the lowest frequency your source will be using. For example, an electric guitar may not need to have any frequencies below 250Hz. This is great to set first, because you can use your Low EQ filter later in your subtractive EQ.

## Step 3 – Set your High-Mid and Low-Mid

High-Mid and Low-Mid filters are some of the most critical parts of the equalization process as they cover most of the unpleasant frequencies known to man. It doesn’t matter which one you start with, but slightly gain the filter up a little bit and slowly sweep the frequencies to the point of the loudest feedback frequency. I say you will know when you hit it because it will pretty much rattle every bone in your head. Once you have found the annoying frequency, cut it below the 0 mark. Be sure not to cut it too much or you may have a loss in audio quality.

## Step 4 – Set your Lows and Highs

If it is sounding extra boomy or really teeny, you can use this time to adjust the lows and highs of your mix. This is a little more of a broad action than the mid sections. On digital consoles, these can be fine-tuned significantly similar to the mid-sections.

## Extra Resources

There are numerous online resources and videos that will help you set up a good EQ. A couple good resources describe how to EQ vocals, drums, guitars, etc: [https://talkinmusic.com/musicproduction/mixing-music/](https://talkinmusic.com/musicproduction/mixing-music/) and [http://www.themusicespionage.co.uk/mixing/how-to-mix/](http://www.themusicespionage.co.uk/mixing/how-to-mix/)
